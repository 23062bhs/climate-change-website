            Scientists link the rise in global temperatures since the mid-20th century to the human-driven increase of the greenhouse effect - a process where heat is trapped in Earth's atmosphere instead of escaping into space.
        </p>
        <p class="more-info">
            Life on Earth relies on energy from the Sun. Roughly half of the sunlight that reaches our atmosphere makes it to the surface, where it is absorbed and then released as infrared radiation (heat). Around 90% of this heat is captured by greenhouse gases and sent back toward Earth, reducing the amount of heat that escapes into space.
        </p>

            What is the Greenhouse Effect?
        </h1>
        <p class="greenhouse-effect-info">
            The greenhouse effect is a natural process that helps keep Earth warm enough to support life. Energy from the Sun reaches our planet as sunlight, and much of it is absorbed by the land and oceans. This absorbed energy is then released back into the atmosphere as heat. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and nitrous oxide trap some of this heat and re-radiate it, preventing it from escaping into space.
        </p>
        <p class="more-info">
            Without the greenhouse effect, Earth's surface would be far too cold for humans, animals, and plants to survive. However, human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes have increased the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This strengthens the greenhouse effect, causing the planet to warm at an accelerated rate, which contributes to climate change and its impacts on ecosystems and weather patterns.

                <p class="carbon-dioxide-info">
                    Carbon dioxide comes from both natural processes and human activity. It is released when animals breathe, from volcanic eruptions, and from the natural decay of plants. Humans add much larger amounts by burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, and through deforestation. Because carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for a very long time, it builds up and is the biggest driver of long-term warming.

                <p class="methane-info">
                    Methane comes from plant matter breaking down in wetlands, but also from human sources. Landfills, rice farming, and livestock like cows and sheep release large amounts of methane. It is also a major part of natural gas, which leaks during fossil fuel drilling and transport. Methane traps much more heat than carbon dioxide, even though it does not last as long in the atmosphere.

                    Nitrous oxide occurs naturally in small amounts from soil and the ocean, but human activity has made its levels much higher. Fertilizers, livestock waste, and certain industrial processes all release nitrous oxide. Although less common than other greenhouse gases, it is very strong at trapping heat and can remain in the atmosphere for more than 100 years.

                <p class="water-vapor-info">
                    Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, and it comes from the natural process of water evaporating into the air. Human activities do not directly release large amounts of water vapor, but rising temperatures caused by other greenhouse gases increase evaporation. This means more water vapor enters the atmosphere, which traps more heat and speeds up global warming.

                <p class="fluorinated-gasses-info">
                    Fluorinated gases are entirely man-made and come from industrial processes, refrigeration, and air conditioning. Common examples include hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF₆), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF₃). These gases are released in much smaller amounts than carbon dioxide or methane, but they are extremely powerful heat-trappers. Some of them can remain in the atmosphere for thousands of years, making them especially dangerous over the long term.

            This is an ice core sample which is a cylinder of ice drilled from glaciers. It holds layers of snow and tiny air bubbles that show what Earth's atmosphere and climate were like thousands of years ago.
        </p>
        <p class="human-activity-info">
            Over the past century, the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil has greatly increased the amount of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the atmosphere. This happens because burning these fuels combines the carbon they contain with oxygen from the air, producing CO₂. Land clearing for farming, industry, and other human activities has also added to the rise of greenhouse gases, though to a lesser extent.
        </p>
        <p class="more-info">
            But how do we know what greenhouse gas levels and global temperatures were like in the distant past? Evidence comes from methods such as studying ice cores, which trap ancient air bubbles, allowing scientists to measure past CO₂ concentrations and compare them with current levels.
        </p>
        <p class="more-info">
            Since the mid-1700s, human activity has raised atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations by nearly 50%. Scientists know this increase comes from humans because the CO₂ in the atmosphere carries a unique isotopic signature that matches fossil fuel sources.
        </p>
        <p class="more-info">
            According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its Sixth Assessment Report, there is no doubt that rising levels of CO₂, methane, and nitrous oxide since the start of the industrial era are caused by human activities. The IPCC also concludes that human influence is the main driver behind many of the significant changes seen in Earth's atmosphere, oceans, frozen regions, and ecosystems.
