            Climate change refers to long-term shifts in the average weather patterns that shape local, regional, and global climates on Earth. These shifts have produced a wide range of effects.
        </h2>
        <h2 class="more-info">
            Since the mid-20th century, human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels have been the main driver of climate change. This process increases the concentration of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, raising Earth’s average surface temperature. Natural processes can also influence climate, such as internal variability (e.g., ocean cycles like El Nino, La Nina, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and external factors (e.g., volcanic eruptions, changes in solar energy, or variations in Earth’s orbit). However, these natural influences have been overshadowed by human impacts.
        </h2>
         <h2 class="more-info">
            Scientists study climate change by combining data from land, air, and space with advanced computer models. Records of climate data reveal clear indicators of change, including rising global land and ocean temperatures, sea level rise, melting glaciers and polar ice, and shifts in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, heatwaves, wildfires, droughts, floods, and changes in rainfall. Alterations in cloud cover and vegetation patterns also serve as evidence.
        </h2>
         <h2 class="more-info">
            It’s important to note that “climate change” and “global warming” are related but not identical concepts. Likewise, “weather” and “climate” are often confused, yet they describe conditions across very different timeframes and scales.

       </h1>
       <h2 class="comparison-info">
            Weather refers to atmospheric conditions the occur locally over short periods of time - from minutes, to hours or even days. Examples of weather include rain, winds, snow, floods and thunderstorms
       </h2>
       <h2 class="more-info">
            Climate, on the other hand, refers to the long-term average patterns of temperature, humidity, and precipitation measured over a region or even the entire globe across seasons, years, or decades (typically 30 years or more).

        </h2>
        <h2 class="global-warming-info">
            Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth's surface observed since the pre-industrial period (1850-1900) due to human activities, mainly fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere. This term is not interchangable with the term "climate change."
        </h2>
        <h2 class="more-info">
            Since the pre-industrial period, human activities are estimated to have increased Earth's global average temperature by about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit), a number that is currently increasing by more than 0.2 degrees Celsius (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade. The current warming trend is unequivocally the result of human activity since the 1950s and is proceeding at an unprecedented rate over the millennia.
