            Global climate change is already happening, not just a problem for the future. Human activities that release heat-trapping greenhouse gases are driving major changes across the planet. Glaciers and ice sheets are melting, rivers and lakes are losing ice earlier, plants and animals are shifting where they live, and many trees and flowers are blooming sooner than before.
        </p>
        <p class="more-info">
            Many of the impacts scientists predicted like melting sea ice, rising sea levels, and longer, more intense heatwaves are now being observed. Some effects, such as stronger droughts, wildfires, and extreme rainfall, are happening even faster than expected. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), modern humans have never experienced climate changes of this scale, and some effects will be irreversible for centuries. 
        </p>
        <p class="more-info">
            The IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (2021) found that human activity has already warmed the planet by about 2°F (1.1°C) since the late 1800s. Within the next few decades, global temperatures are expected to reach or exceed 1.5°C (3°F). The extent of future impacts depends on human choices if emissions continue to rise, the world will face harsher extremes, but cutting emissions now can reduce risks and prevent the worst outcomes.

                <p class="global-temperatures-info">
                    Average global temperatures are expected to rise significantly throughout the 21st century, with some regions heating up faster than others. This warming will bring longer, hotter summers and far more frequent heatwaves, which can damage crops, reduce food supplies, and put enormous pressure on energy systems as demand for cooling rises. Extreme heat also increases health risks such as heatstroke, dehydration, and respiratory problems. Vulnerable groups like the elderly, young children, and those with existing health conditions will be the most at risk, while entire communities may face dangerous living conditions in areas where extreme heat becomes normal.

                <p class="sea-levels-info">
                    Melting glaciers, shrinking ice sheets, and the expansion of seawater as it warms are expected to cause sea levels to rise at an accelerating pace. Low-lying coastal regions will be most affected, with millions of people at risk of displacement as their homes become uninhabitable. Critical infrastructure such as ports, highways, and sewage systems are also vulnerable, potentially leading to billions of dollars in damage each year. Saltwater intrusion from rising seas could contaminate freshwater supplies and harm agriculture in coastal areas, further threatening food and water security for large populations.

                <p class="weather-info">
                    Warmer oceans provide more energy for storms, making hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons stronger and more destructive. These storms are expected to produce heavier rainfall, stronger winds, and more devastating flooding. Communities in storm-prone areas may experience repeated destruction of homes, schools, and businesses, creating long-term economic and social challenges. In addition to tropical storms, other extreme weather events such as intense rainfall, blizzards, and severe windstorms are becoming more common, making it harder for communities to prepare and recover.

                <p class="droughts-info">
                    In many parts of the world, higher temperatures will lead to more intense and prolonged droughts. Rainfall patterns are shifting, and in some regions, precipitation will become less reliable, threatening water supplies for both people and agriculture. Drying soils make it increasingly difficult to grow staple crops, leading to food shortages and rising prices. Competition for limited water resources could spark conflicts between communities and even nations. At the same time, ecosystems that rely on stable water supplies, such as wetlands and forests, will face long-term stress that could lead to permanent environmental changes.

                <p class="wildfires-info">
                    With hotter, drier conditions, wildfires are projected to increase in frequency, size, and intensity. Forests that once provided habitats for wildlife and stored carbon will face more frequent destruction, releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. Communities near fire-prone areas will be at constant risk of losing homes, schools, and infrastructure to uncontrollable flames. In addition to the physical destruction, wildfire smoke creates hazardous air quality, leading to respiratory illnesses and increasing health risks even for people living far from the fires themselves. The cycle of warming and fires will reinforce itself, making this a growing global problem.

                <p class="risks-info">
                    The health risks associated with climate change are expected to grow dramatically in the coming decades. Extreme heat events will increase cases of heatstroke and dehydration, while rising air pollution from fossil fuels and wildfire smoke will worsen asthma and other respiratory diseases. Warmer conditions will also expand the range of insects such as mosquitoes and ticks, which spread diseases like malaria, dengue fever, and Lyme disease. In addition, disasters such as floods and storms can contaminate drinking water and damage healthcare infrastructure, leaving communities vulnerable. Together, these health challenges will strain healthcare systems worldwide and increase the risk of widespread health crises.
