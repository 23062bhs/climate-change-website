            The Planet Will Keep Heating and the Effects Will Be Severe

            Global climate change is not just a concern for the future, it is already happening now. Human activities that release heat-trapping greenhouse gases are driving changes across the planet. Glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking, rivers and lakes are losing their ice earlier in the year, plants and animals are shifting where they live, and many trees and flowers are blooming sooner than before.
        </h2>
        <h2 class="more-info">
            Many of the impacts scientists predicted would come with climate change are now being observed. These include the loss of sea ice, faster sea level rise, and longer, more intense heatwaves.
        </h2>
        <h2 class="more-info">
            Some effects, like stronger droughts, wildfires, and extreme rainfall, are unfolding even faster than scientists had expected. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) — a United Nations group of experts on climate science — modern humans have never before experienced climate changes of this scale. What's more, some of these changes will be irreversible for hundreds or even thousands of years.
        </h2>
        <h2 class="more-info">
            Scientists are confident that global temperatures will continue to climb for decades to come, mostly because of greenhouse gases produced by human activities. The IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (2021) found that human emissions have already warmed the planet by about 2°F (1.1°C) since the late 1800s. Within the next few decades, the global average temperature is expected to reach or pass 1.5°C (around 3°F). These shifts will impact every part of the world.
        </h2>
        <h2 class="more-info">
            The extent of future climate impacts depends on human choices. If emissions continue to rise, the world will face harsher extremes and widespread damage. But if we reduce emissions, we can lessen the risks and avoid some of the most severe consequences of climate change.

                    Average global temperatures are expected to continue rising throughout this century. This warming will lead to longer, hotter summers and more frequent heatwaves. Extreme heat can damage crops, reduce food supplies, and strain energy systems as demand for cooling increases. It also poses a serious threat to human health, especially for vulnerable groups such as the elderly and children.
